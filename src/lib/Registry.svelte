    <h1>Registry</h1>
    <p>
      We are so grateful for your love and support as we embark on this exciting
      journey together! While we have created a registry for those who wish to
      celebrate with us through gifts, please know that your presence at our
      wedding is the greatest gift of all. Thank you for being a part of our
      special day! If youâ€™d like to explore our registry, you can find it below.
      Additionally, a card box and gift table will be available at our venue.
